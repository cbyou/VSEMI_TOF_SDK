Introduction

   VSEMI ToF SDK is the development kit for Sentinel-V3 ToF camera, developed by Visionary Semiconductor Inc.

   Built with the Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth vision technology, Sentinel-V3 was designed for reliable depth sensing with high accuracy. 
   It was developed for easy and fast development and/or deployment in real applications, such as robotics, drones, and automotives. 
   As a ToF 3D camera, Sentinel-V3 does not require moving components and is thus robust and wear-free. 

Sample applications:

-sample1:                   work with raw data with minimum_dependency

-sample2:                   work with depth map and point cloud in ROS environment

-sample3:                   work with depth map and point cloud using OpenCV and PCL

-sample4:                   work with depth map, point cloud and RGB camera in ROS environment

-sample5:                   work with depth map, point cloud and RGB camera using OpenCV and PCL

-sample6:                   work with depth map with OpenCV
   
To be started, please read instructions in docs folder to build and run the sample applications.
