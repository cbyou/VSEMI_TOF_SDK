Introduction

   VSEMI ToF SDK is the development kit for Sentinel-V3 ToF camera, developed by Visionary Semiconductor Inc.

   Built with the Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth vision technology, Sentinel-V3 was designed for reliable depth sensing with high accuracy. 
   It was developed for easy and fast development and/or deployment in real applications, such as robotics, drones, and automotives. 
   As a ToF 3D camera, Sentinel-V3 does not require moving components and is thus robust and wear-free.
