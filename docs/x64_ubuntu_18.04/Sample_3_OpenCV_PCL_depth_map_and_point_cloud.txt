The sample 3, to work with OpenCV and PCL to show depth map and point cloud obtained from ToF sensor, which requires ROS Melodic or PCL as dependencies.

Prerequisites:

  x64
  ubuntu 18.04
  ROS Melodic

Before you start

  If you already have "ROS Melodic" installed, go to the section of "Build and run the sample application". 
  
  If you do not have "ROS Melodic" installed, install "ROS Melodic" (refer to "Sample_2_ROS_depth_map_and_point_cloud.txt", section "Install ROS Melodic") and go to the section of "Build and run the sample application".
  
Build and run the sample application

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK archive into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample desktop application:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3

  >> mkdir build && cd build

  >> cmake .. -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=x64_ubuntu_18.04

  >> make

4. To start the sample desktop application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3/build

  >> ./vsemi_tof_cam

5. To stop the application, press Esc key when the depth map window active, or use mouse to close the point cloud window.
