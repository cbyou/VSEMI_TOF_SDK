Sample 6, to work with OpenCV to show depth map with minimum dependencies, no PCL required and no point cloud visualization.

Prerequisites:

  x64
  ubuntu 18.04
  cmake 3.5 +
  boost 1.65 +
  OpenCV
  
Before you start

  If you already have dependencies installed for Sample3 (Sample_3_OpenCV_PCL_depth_map_and_point_cloud.txt), go to the section of "Build and run sample application", otherwise go to step "Install dependencies".

Install dependencies

  >> sudo apt-get update
  
  >> sudo apt install git build-essential cmake

Install OpenCV

  ## Download OpenCV v4.1.1 source from here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.1.1.zip

  ## Extract the package into a directory (this guide use /home directory as an example). There should be: ~/opencv-4.1.1

  ## Open a terminal and run following commands:

  >> cd ~/opencv-4.1.1
	
  >> mkdir build
    
  >> cd build
    
  >> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .. -DBUILD_LIBPROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCES=ON -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF
    
  >> make -j4
    
  >> sudo make install
  
Build and run sample application

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK.zip into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample desktop application:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample6

  >> mkdir build && cd build

  >> cmake .. -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=x64_ubuntu_18.04

  >> make

4. To start the sample desktop application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample6/build

  >> ./vsemi_tof_cam

5. To stop the application, press Esc key when the depth map window active, or use mouse to close the point cloud window.
